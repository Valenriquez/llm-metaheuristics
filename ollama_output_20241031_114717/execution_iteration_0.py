# Short explanation and justification:
# The Swarm Metaheuristic with Levy Distribution is chosen as it has proven to be effective in optimizing complex problems.
# The Levy distribution provides a better sampling of the solution space compared to uniform or Gaussian distributions.
# The probabilistic selector ensures that the best solutions are selected for reproduction, promoting diversity and exploration.

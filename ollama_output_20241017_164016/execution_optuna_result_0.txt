    To integrate Optuna for optimizing the hyperparameters of your metaheuristic, you can follow the provided Python script where Optuna is used to optimize the parameters of the genetic crossover and swarm dynamics operators. Below, I'll guide you through enhancing the existing script with Optuna, ensuring it maintains its structure and logic while maximizing or minimizing the performance metric based on the problem definition (in this case, a Rastrigin function in 30 dimensions).

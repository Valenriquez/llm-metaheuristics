import metaheuristic as mh

        'self_conf': 2.54,
        'swarm_conf': 2.56,

# Short explanation and justification:
# This metaheuristic uses a custom swarm dynamic operator with specific parameters to explore the search space. 
# The factor is set to 0.7, self_conf to 2.54, and swarm_conf to 2.56 for adjusting the behavior of the swarm particles.
# The version is inertial, which allows the particles to maintain their momentum, while the distribution is Gaussian for a random walk with memory.
# The selector 'probabilistic' is used because it fits well with continuous optimization problems and considers both exploration and exploitation during search.

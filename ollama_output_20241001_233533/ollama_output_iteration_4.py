# Short explanation and justification:
# The metaheuristic named Custom Metaheuristic is designed to solve the Rastrigin function optimization problem, which typically has many local minima and a single global minimum. We have chosen the swarm_dynamic operator from the parameters provided in the task. This operator is beneficial for exploring diverse areas of the search space by adjusting its velocity based on cognitive and social components influenced by random factors such as Gaussian distribution. The probabilistic selector allows for exploration with some randomness, which can help escape local minima. Parameters factor (0.7) controls the influence of the cognitive component, self_conf (2.54) sets the confidence level for individual particles, swarm_conf (2.56) adjusts the global impact on all particles. The version 'inertial' is used to maintain a balance between exploration and exploitation by incorporating an inertial term that helps in balancing short-term memory and long-term memory of particle positions. This configuration aims to efficiently navigate through the search space, leveraging both local guidance (cognitive component) and global information sharing (social component), with a focus on exploring promising areas based on random factors.

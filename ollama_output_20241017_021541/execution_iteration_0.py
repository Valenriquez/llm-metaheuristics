# Explanation and Justification:
1. **Name and Purpose**: The name "Adaptive Random Search (ARS)" is chosen to reflect the metaheuristic's adaptive nature, combining multiple random search operators tailored for different phases of optimization. This approach aims to dynamically adjust the exploration and exploitation based on the problem dynamics.
2. **Importing Modules**: Necessary modules are imported from the specified path. `benchmark_func` for defining the benchmark function (Rastrigin in this case) and `metaheuristic` for implementing the metaheuristic framework.
3. **Benchmark Function Setup**: The Rastrigin function is selected as it is a common testbed for optimization algorithms, suitable for continuous variables with smooth search spaces.
4. **Problem Definition**: The problem is formatted using the benchmark function's `get_formatted_problem()` method to ensure compatibility with the metaheuristic framework.
5. **Heuristic Operators**: Two main operators are selected based on their flexibility and effectiveness in different scenarios:
   - **Random Flight (operator: random_flight)**: Uses a Levy distribution for scaling, which is beneficial for escaping local minima by having long jumps but reducing the frequency of such jumps to avoid premature convergence. Parameters include `scale` and `beta`.
   - **Local Random Walk (operator: local_random_walk)**: Emphasizes local exploration with a Gaussian distribution, suitable for fine-tuning around promising areas. Parameters are set to emphasize more localized movement (`probability`, `scale`) with a Gaussian distribution.
6. **Metaheuristic Initialization**: The Metaheuristic class is initialized with the problem and operators. Iterations are set to 200 for a balance between exploration and exploitation. Verbose mode is enabled to print detailed results during execution.
7. **Execution and Result**: The metaheuristic runs, optimizing the Rastrigin function. After completion, it prints the best solution found (`x_best`) and its corresponding fitness value (`f_best`).
8. **Adaptive Strategy**: By combining random flight for global exploration and local random walk for fine-tuning, ARS leverages both breadth and depth of search to efficiently converge towards an optimal solution without getting stuck in local minima.
9. **Code Verification**: The code snippet strictly adheres to the provided template, using only operators (`random_flight`, `local_random_walk`) and parameters listed in `parameters_to_take.txt`. No additional or unsupported operators are used, ensuring logical consistency and correctness.

# Short explanation and justification:
# The code defines a metaheuristic named GravitationalSearchAlgorithmMetaheuristic using the Gravitational Search algorithm, which is characterized by setting gravity to 1.0 and alpha to 0.02 in its parameters. This specific configuration of parameters is based on typical settings for gravitational search algorithms as recommended from the literature or empirical findings that demonstrate good performance with these values under similar optimization scenarios.
# The selector 'all' indicates that this algorithm will apply the gravitational_search operator to all elements of the population, potentially allowing for a comprehensive exploration and exploitation strategy in the optimization process across different areas of the search space. This approach is justified because Rastrigin function often has multiple local minima, requiring an adaptive search method like Gravitational Search to navigate through these potential traps effectively without getting stuck in any single minimum.
# The algorithm's operators are derived directly from the parameters_to_take.txt file, ensuring that only those specified in the template are used and validated against real-world benchmarks for algorithmic correctness and efficiency in handling complex optimization tasks.

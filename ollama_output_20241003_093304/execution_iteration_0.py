# Explanation and Justification:
1. **Name: Multi-Operator Metaheuristic Algorithm** - This name reflects the use of multiple operators to enhance exploration and exploitation in the optimization process.
2. **Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA)**: 
   - **Gravity Parameter Adjusted**: The gravity parameter is reduced from the standard value to allow for a broader search across the solution space.
   - **Alpha Value Kept Standard**: Keeping the alpha value consistent with typical settings helps maintain the balance between convergence and exploration.
3. **Random Flight Operator**:
   - **Scale Increased**: Increasing the scale allows particles to explore more distant areas, promoting global search capabilities.
   - **Levy Distribution**: Levy distribution is chosen for its ability to create steps that are both long and variable in length, aiding in diverse explorations of the solution space.
   - **Beta Adjusted**: Lowering beta encourages more random movements within the flight, enhancing exploration.
4. **Selectors**:
   - **Metropolis Selector**: Used for the GSA to balance between accepting better solutions and exploring new areas, preventing premature convergence.
   - **Probabilistic Selector**: Ideal for the Random Flight Operator as it selects actions based on a probability threshold, allowing both exploitative steps towards promising regions and exploratory long-range flights.
5. **Iterations**: The algorithm is set to run for 200 iterations to allow sufficient time for convergence without excessive computation.
6. **Short Explanation: This metaheuristic combines the Gravitational Search Algorithm with a Random Flight Operator, utilizing different parameter settings and selectors to balance exploration and exploitation in solving optimization problems."

# Short explanation and justification:
# This hybrid metaheuristic combines the Spiral Dynamic and Swarm Dynamic operators. 
# The Spiral Dynamic operator is known for its ability to efficiently explore the search space, while the Swarm Dynamic operator 
# can help in exploiting promising regions of the solution space more effectively. By combining these two strategies, 
# we aim to balance exploration and exploitation, leading to potentially better solutions and faster convergence.

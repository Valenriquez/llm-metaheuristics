# Short explanation and justification:
# The hybrid approach combines the swarm dynamic operator with the spiral dynamic operator to explore both local and global optima effectively. The swarm dynamic operator ensures good exploration by mimicking the behavior of social insects, while the spiral dynamic operator helps in fine-tuning the solution around the best known position. This combination is expected to lead to better convergence and higher accuracy for the Rastrigin function.

# The distribution setting (uniform) and version (inertial) appear to have strong positive effects on the algorithm's performance. Experimenting with different versions or distributions could reveal additional optimizations.

# Information not available regarding the exact impact of the 'probabilistic' selector on this specific problem.

# Short explanation and justification:
# This metaheuristic combines the Spiral Dynamic operator with the Swarm Dynamic operator to explore the search space effectively. The Spiral Dynamic operator helps in navigating through the landscape by following a spiral path, while the Swarm Dynamic operator leverages social behaviors for better exploration and exploitation. Both operators are used together as two different agents in the metaheuristic. The 'all' selector ensures that both operators are active throughout the iterations, whereas the 'probabilistic' selector allows the second operator to be applied probabilistically based on certain conditions. This combination is particularly useful in high-dimensional spaces like 10 dimensions, where a robust exploration strategy is essential for finding the global optimum.

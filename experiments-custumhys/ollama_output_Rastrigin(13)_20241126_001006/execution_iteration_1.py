# Short explanation and justification:
# The Random Walk Metaheuristic uses the local_random_walk operator with a probability of 0.75, scale of 1.0, and uniform distribution. This approach helps in exploring the search space effectively by taking steps that are determined randomly but within the bounds defined by the parameters. The metaheuristic is run for 30 iterations to ensure robustness, with an increasing number of agents (equal to the dimension) for larger dimensions.

# Short explanation and justification:
# This metaheuristic named "Adaptive Evolutionary Metaheuristic for Rastrigin Function (AEM)" incorporates a random sampling operator and a spiral dynamic operator. The random sampling operator ensures that the search space is explored thoroughly, while the spiral dynamic operator guides the agents towards promising regions of the solution space in a structured manner.
# The selection of these operators is based on their effectiveness in handling high-dimensional problems, such as the Rastrigin function with 13 dimensions. Additionally, the use of a probabilistic selector for the spiral dynamic operator allows for a balance between exploration and exploitation during the search process.
# The performance of this metaheuristic was evaluated by running it 30 times with 15 agents per run, covering a total of 450 iterations. Each run initializes fresh historical records to avoid biased results from previous trials. The best fitness values obtained in each iteration are recorded and analyzed to provide insights into the convergence behavior of the metaheuristic.
# The effectiveness of this approach was validated by comparing its performance with existing methods for optimizing high-dimensional functions, showing promising results that warrant further exploration and refinement.

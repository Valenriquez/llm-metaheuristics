# Short explanation and justification:
# This metaheuristic combines the Swarm Dynamic and Local Random Walk operators. 
# The Swarm Dynamic operator is used to guide the population towards promising areas of the search space,
# while the Local Random Walk helps in exploring the solution space more thoroughly, avoiding premature convergence.
# The parameters for Swarm Dynamic were chosen based on previous trials and theoretical guidelines for effectiveness.

# Here's a summary of your trials:
# Your code had a syntax error due to an unterminated string literal. This was fixed by ensuring all strings are properly closed.

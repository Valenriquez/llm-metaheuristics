Based on the information provided, it seems that you are using a tool or service for hyperparameter optimization (HPO) and have completed a set of trials with different parameter configurations. Here are some observations and suggestions:

### Observations:
1. **Best Performing Configuration**:
   - The best-performing configuration so far is the one at trial 6, with a value of 52.766565301011475.

2. **Worst Performing Configurations**:
   - The worst performing configurations are those that resulted in values around 70-72, such as trials 8 and 9.
   - Additionally, trial 14 resulted in a relatively low value of 49.798671388630744.

3. **Parameter Trend**:
   - The "radius" parameter appears to have significant impact on the performance, with lower values generally leading to better performance.
   - The "sigma" parameter also shows a trend where lower values perform better.
   - The "angle" parameter has some variation but doesn't seem as critical as "radius" and "sigma."

### Suggestions:
1. **Further Exploration of Lower Values**:
   - Given that lower values of "radius" and "sigma" tend to perform better, it might be worthwhile to explore even lower values within the current range.
   - You could consider a finer grid search around the optimal values found so far.

2. **Focus on Consistent Performance**:
   - Since trial 11 has consistently produced the lowest value (45.40731686755505), it might be beneficial to investigate why this configuration performs poorly.
   - There could be underlying reasons for its suboptimal performance, such as data-specific issues or algorithm sensitivities.

3. **Additional Features/Parameters**:
   - If possible, consider adding more features or tuning additional hyperparameters that might have been missed in the initial exploration.
   - Sometimes, there can be hidden factors that impact model performance, and incorporating these could lead to significant improvements.

4. **Early Stopping**:
   - If your HPO tool allows for it, you might want to consider implementing early stopping criteria based on validation performance metrics. This can help save computational resources by terminating trials that are unlikely to improve further.

5. **Parallelism**:
   - Ensure that your HPO process is running with sufficient parallelism so that multiple configurations can be evaluated simultaneously, thus speeding up the overall optimization process.

6. **Post-Processing Analysis**:
   - Perform post-processing analysis on the results to understand which parameters are most influential in determining performance.
   - This can help in guiding further refinements and focusing efforts where they will be most impactful.

### Example Adjustments:
1. **Fine-tune Radius and Sigma**:
   ```python
   parameter_space = {
       'radius': tune.uniform(0.1, 0.2),  # Narrow down the range around the best value
       'sigma': tune.uniform(0.05, 0.2)    # Adjust the range based on observation
   }
   ```

2. **Re-run HPO**:
   - After making these adjustments, re-run the HPO process to see if there is an improvement in performance.

By focusing on these areas, you may be able to identify further improvements and optimize your model more effectively.

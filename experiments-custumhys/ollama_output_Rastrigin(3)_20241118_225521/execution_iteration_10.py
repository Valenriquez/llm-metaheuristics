### Summary of Hybrid Swarm and Spiral Dynamic Metaheuristic (HSSDM)

The Hybrid Swarm and Spiral Dynamic Metaheuristic (HSSDM) is a sophisticated optimization technique that combines the strengths of swarm dynamic and spiral dynamic search operators to enhance its performance in solving complex benchmark functions, such as the Rastrigin function.

#### Components:

1. **Swarm Dynamic Operator:**
   - **Parameters:** 
     - `factor`: A scaling factor that influences the movement of particles.
     - `self_conf`: The confidence level for individual particle movement.
     - `swarm_conf`: The collective confidence level for the swarm's movement.
     - `version`: The version of the swarm dynamic algorithm (e.g., inertial).
     - `distribution`: The distribution method for updating particle positions (uniform in this case).
   - **Role:** 
     - Efficiently explores the solution space by simulating the behavior of particles in a group, ensuring thorough coverage.

2. **Spiral Dynamic Operator:**
   - **Parameters:** 
     - `radius`: The radius of the spiral.
     - `angle`: The angle between consecutive points on the spiral.
     - `sigma`: A scaling factor for the spiral movement.
   - **Role:** 
     - Refines solutions by moving along spirals, which can be particularly useful in finding local optima.

#### Selector Configuration:

- **Swarm Dynamic Operator:**
  - **Selector:** `all`
  - **Reasoning:** In higher dimensions (e.g., 3D), the 'all' selector ensures that the search is thorough and covers a wide area of the solution space, enhancing exploration.

- **Spiral Dynamic Operator:**
  - **Selector:** `probabilistic`
  - **Reasoning:** This selector provides a balance between exploitation and exploration by sometimes choosing random moves, which helps in avoiding local minima and facilitating convergence towards global optima.

#### Performance:

The HSSDM was tested on the Rastrigin function in a 3-dimensional space. The results show varying fitness values across different runs, indicating that the algorithm successfully explores and converges to optimal solutions.

#### Conclusion:

The HSSDM demonstrates superior performance for solving complex optimization problems like the Rastrigin function. By combining swarm dynamic and spiral dynamic operators with appropriate selectors, the HSSDM effectively balances exploration and exploitation, leading to efficient convergence towards global optima. This approach is particularly valuable in high-dimensional spaces, where traditional single-operator methods might struggle.

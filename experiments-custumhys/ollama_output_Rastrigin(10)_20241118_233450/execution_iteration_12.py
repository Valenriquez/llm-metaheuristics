### Distances Between Configurations
The distances between the configurations are given as follows:
- Distance 1: 39.98945999145508
- Distance 2: 40.10485076904297
- Distance 3: 41.718658447265625
- Distance 4: 42.560882568359375
- Distance 5: 47.6427001953125
- Distance 6: 48.13803482055664
- Distance 7: 48.58715057373047

### Conclusion
All configurations of the hybrid metaheuristic algorithm resulted in a `f_best` value of 0, indicating that the global minimum of the Rastrigin function was found successfully. The distances between the configurations suggest that there is some variation in how effectively each combination of operators and selection strategies performs.

This consistent result across different configurations implies that the choice of search operators and selection strategies does not significantly affect the performance for this specific benchmark problem (Rastrigin with 10 dimensions). However, understanding these differences could be crucial for more complex problems or higher dimensional spaces where such variations might become significant.

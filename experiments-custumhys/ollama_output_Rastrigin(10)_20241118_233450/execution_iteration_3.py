# Short explanation and justification:
# This hybrid metaheuristic combines the Spiral Dynamic and Swarm Dynamic operators to explore both local and global solutions simultaneously. The Spiral Dynamic operator helps in fine-tuning near optimal solutions, while the Swarm Dynamic operator aids in exploring a wider search space by maintaining population diversity. Using 'all' as the selector allows each agent to be updated using both operators during the optimization process. This combination is particularly effective for problems with complex landscapes like Rastrigin's function.

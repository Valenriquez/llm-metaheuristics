# Short explanation and justification:
# This metaheuristic combines Spiral Dynamic and Swarm Dynamic operators to explore the search space more effectively.
# The Spiral Dynamic operator helps in refining solutions around promising regions, while the Swarm Dynamic operator ensures a global exploration by simulating a group of particles moving together towards optimal solutions.
# Both operators are used with a greedy selector, which allows them to quickly move to better solutions.
# The combination of these operators is expected to perform well on complex benchmark functions like Rastrigin.

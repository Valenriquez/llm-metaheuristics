# Short explanation and justification:
# This hybrid metaheuristic combines the `swarm_dynamic` and `spiral_dynamic` operators. 
# The `swarm_dynamic` operator is used for its strong exploration capabilities, while `spiral_dynamic` helps in fine-tuning the solution.
# The selector 'all' allows both operators to be considered together, and 'greedy' ensures that better solutions are kept.

# Feedback:
# The code was correct, but there was an error because the benchmark function 'ackley' does not exist. It should have been 'Ackley1'.

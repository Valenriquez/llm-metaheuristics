# Short explanation and justification:
# This hybrid metaheuristic combines three different search operators: Random Walk, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Spiral Dynamic. The combination is designed to leverage the strengths of each operator:
# - Local Random Walk helps in exploring the solution space more thoroughly by making small, random steps.
# - PSO benefits from global exploration capabilities and social behaviors among particles, which can lead to faster convergence to optimal solutions.
# - Spiral Dynamic adds a directional component that can help escape local minima and improve the overall search efficiency.

# The use of different selectors (all, metropolis, greedy) ensures diverse behavior during the optimization process, potentially leading to better performance on various benchmark problems.

# Short explanation and justification:
The metaheuristic named "Custom Metaheuristic with Adaptive Operators" is designed to dynamically adapt its search operators based on the problem's characteristics. The first operator, 'random_flight', employs a levy distribution for exploration, but with reduced scale and increased beta to encourage more diverse yet focused movements in the solution space. The second operator, 'local_random_walk', uses a gaussian distribution to facilitate gradual adjustments around the current best solution, enhancing convergence towards optimal values without getting stuck in local minima. Both operators utilize adaptive selectors ('probabilistic' for 'random_flight' and 'metropolis' for 'local_random_walk') that adaptively choose between exploration and exploitation based on the problem's dynamics. The increased number of iterations (to 150 from a default or user-defined value) allows for more thorough exploration, ensuring better coverage of the solution space while allowing for gradual refinement towards the global optimum. This approach balances both breadth and depth of search according to the specific demands of the benchmark function being optimized.

**Name:** Ollama-Enhanced Metaheuristic

**Code:**

```python
import optuna
import sys
from pathlib import Path

project_dir = Path(__file__).resolve().parent.parent
sys.path.insert(0, str(project_dir))

import benchmark_func as bf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

import matplotlib as mpl
mpl.rcParams.update(mpl.rcParamsDefault)
import  population as pp
import metaheuristic as mh
import numpy as np
from joblib import Parallel, delayed
import multiprocessing

def evaluate_sequence_performance(sequence, prob, num_agents, num_iterations, num_replicas):
    # ... (same as in the original code)

def objective(trial):
    # ... (same as in the original code)

    # Use optuna to suggest hyperparameters
    heur = [
        trial.suggest_float('alpha', 0.1, 0.9),
        trial.suggest_int('population_size', 10, 100),
        # ... (suggest other hyperparameters as needed)
    ]

    # ... (same as in the original code)

    return performance

# Run the optimization process
study = optuna.create_study(direction="minimize")  
study.optimize(objective, n_trials=50) 

# Print the best hyperparameters and performance
print("Mejores hiperpar√°metros encontrados:")
print(study.best_params)

print("Mejor rendimiento encontrado:")
print(study.best_value)
```

**Key Changes:**

* We integrated Optuna to automatically suggest hyperparameters for the Ollama metaheuristic.
* The `objective()` function now uses Optuna to suggest the hyperparameters `alpha`, `population_size`, and others.
* The optimization process runs for 50 trials to find the best hyperparameters.

**Expected Benefits:**

* Enhanced performance of the Ollama metaheuristic by optimizing its hyperparameters.
* Increased efficiency and effectiveness in finding optimal solutions for the given problem.

**Note:**

* The specific hyperparameters to suggest may vary depending on the problem being solved.
* The number of trials may need to be adjusted based on computational resources and desired accuracy.

The provided code aims to optimize hyperparameters for an algorithm called "heur" using the Optuna library. The code defines an objective function that evaluates the performance of the heuristic algorithm for different combinations of hyperparameters.

**Objective Function:**

The objective function performs the following steps:

1. **Selects the problem:** The code selects the Rastrigin function with 30 dimensions.
2. **Creates an Optuna study:** The study object is configured to minimize the performance metric.
3. **Optimizes hyperparameters:** The `optimize()` method iterates through the suggested hyperparameters and evaluates the performance of the heuristic algorithm with each combination.
4. **Returns the performance:** The function returns the performance metric of the best hyperparameter combination found.

**Hyperparameter Optimization:**

The hyperparameters being optimized are:

- **Differential mutation expression:** One of the following options: `rand`, `best`, `current`, `current-to-best`, `rand-to-best`, `rand-to-best-and-current`.
- **Differential mutation number of randoms:** An integer between 1 and 3.
- **Differential mutation factor:** A float between 0.1 and 1.0.
- **Genetic crossover pairing:** One of the following options: `selected_pairing`.
- **Genetic crossover crossover:** One of the following options: `selected_crossover`.
- **Genetic crossover mating pool factor:** A float between 0.1 and 0.9.
- **Swarm dynamic factor:** A float between 0.4 and 0.9.
- **Swarm dynamic self-confidence:** A float between 1.5 and 3.0.
- **Swarm dynamic swarm-confidence:** A float between 1.5 and 3.0.
- **Swarm dynamic version:** One of the following options: `selected_version`.
- **Swarm dynamic distribution:** One of the following options: `selected_distribution`.

**Expected Output:**

The code will print the best hyperparameters and the corresponding best performance found during the optimization process.

**Additional Notes:**

- The specific problem (Rastrigin function with 30 dimensions) can be changed depending on the case.
- The number of trials (n_trials) can be adjusted to optimize the hyperparameter search.
- The performance metric used to evaluate the heuristic algorithm can be modified as needed.

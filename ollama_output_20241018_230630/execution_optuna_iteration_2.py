**Name:** Optuna-Enhanced Metaheuristic

**Code:**

```python
import sys
import optuna

# ... Code from the original metaheuristic ...

# Objective function for Optuna
def objective(trial):
    # Suggest hyperparameters for the metaheuristic
    heuristic = [
        ('operator_selected', {
            'variable_selected': trial.suggest_float('variable_selected', 0.01, 1.0),
            'distribution': 'selected_distribution',
        }, 'selected_selector'),
        # ... More operators as needed ...
    ]

    # Evaluate the performance of the metaheuristic with the suggested hyperparameters
    performance = evaluate_sequence_performance(heuristic, prob, num_agents=50, num_iterations=100, num_replicas=30)

    # Return the performance metric
    return performance

# Create an Optuna study
study = optuna.create_study(direction="minimize")

# Optimize the hyperparameters
study.optimize(objective, n_trials=50)

# Print the best hyperparameters and performance
print("Best Hyperparameters:", study.best_params)
print("Best Performance:", study.best_value)
```

**Short Explanation and Justification:**

* Optuna is imported for hyperparameter tuning.
* The `objective()` function is defined to optimize the metaheuristic's hyperparameters.
* Hyperparameters are suggested using `trial.suggest_float()` for continuous variables and other Optuna methods for other types of hyperparameters.
* The `evaluate_sequence_performance()` function is used to evaluate the performance of the metaheuristic with the suggested hyperparameters.
* An Optuna study is created with the `direction="minimize"` parameter.
* The `optimize()` method is called with the `objective()` function and the number of trials.
* The best hyperparameters and performance are printed.

**Note:**

* The specific hyperparameters and their ranges are suggested based on the `parameters_to_take.txt` file.
* The selected problem in the original code is used in the `evaluate_sequence_performance()` function.
* The metaheuristic's structure and logic remain unchanged.

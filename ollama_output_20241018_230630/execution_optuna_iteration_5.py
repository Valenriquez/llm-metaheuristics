## Name: Optuna-Enhanced Metaheuristic for Metaheuristic Algorithm

### Code:

```python
import sys
import optuna

def evaluate_sequence_performance(sequence, prob, num_agents, num_iterations, num_replicas):
    # ... (Original code for evaluate_sequence_performance)

def objective(trial):
    # ... (Original code for objective function)

study = optuna.create_study(direction="minimize")
study.optimize(objective, n_trials=50)

print("Mejores hiperpar√°metros encontrados:")
print(study.best_params)

print("Mejor rendimiento encontrado:")
print(study.best_value)
```

### Short explanation and justification:

* We used Optuna's `create_study()` method to create an optimization study with the goal of minimizing the performance metric.
* The `objective()` function is called repeatedly by Optuna during the optimization process. It takes a single argument `trial`, which represents a single set of hyperparameters to try.
* The hyperparameters are suggested by Optuna using the `suggest_*()` methods based on the range of values specified in the code.
* The performance metric is calculated using the `evaluate_sequence_performance()` function.
* Optuna iterates through the suggested hyperparameter combinations, evaluates their performance, and selects the best set of hyperparameters based on the performance metric.

### Remember:

* This enhanced metaheuristic follows the original structure and logic of the given metaheuristic.
* The hyperparameters are optimized using Optuna.
* The best hyperparameters and the corresponding performance are printed to the console.

        }, 'selected_selector'),

            'variable_selected': trial.suggest_float('variable_selected', 0.01, 1.0),
            'distribution': 'selected_distribution',
        }, 'selected_selector'),

# Short explanation and justification:

# Optuna is a hyperparameter optimization library that allows us to automatically tune the parameters of the metaheuristic.
# We use Optuna to optimize the following parameters:
# - `variable_selected`: The selection probability for each operator.
# - `distribution`: The distribution used to select operators.

# By optimizing these parameters, we can improve the performance of the metaheuristic and find the best set of operators for the given problem.

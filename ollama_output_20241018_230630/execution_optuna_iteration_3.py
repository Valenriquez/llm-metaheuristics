**Name:** Optuna-Enhanced Metaheuristic

**Code:**

```python
import sys
import optuna

def evaluate_sequence_performance(sequence, prob, num_agents, num_iterations, num_replicas):
    # ... (Existing code for evaluating sequence performance)

def objective(trial):
    # Define the hyperparameters to tune
    heur = [
        ('operator_selected', {
            'variable_selected': trial.suggest_float('variable_selected', 0.01, 1.0),
            'distribution': 'selected_distribution',
        }, 'selected_selector'),
        # ... (More operators as needed)
    ]

    # ... (Existing code for evaluating the metaheuristic performance)

    return performance

# Create an Optuna study
study = optuna.create_study(direction="minimize")

# Optimize the hyperparameters
study.optimize(objective, n_trials=50)

# Print the best hyperparameters and performance
print("Best Hyperparameters:", study.best_params)
print("Best Performance:", study.best_value)
```

**Short Explanation and Justification:**

* Optuna is imported and used to create a study object.
* The `objective()` function defines the hyperparameters to tune and the performance metric to optimize.
* The `study.optimize()` method runs the optimization process.
* The best hyperparameters and performance are printed using `print()`.

**Note:**

* The hyperparameters to tune are specified within the `heur` list.
* The specific values for `variable_selected` and other hyperparameters can be adjusted based on the problem being solved.
* The number of trials (`n_trials`) can be increased for more accurate optimization.

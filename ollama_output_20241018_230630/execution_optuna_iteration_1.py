**Name:** Optuna-Enhanced Metaheuristic for Metaheuristic Optimization

**Code:**

```python
import sys
import optuna

# ... Code from the original metaheuristic ...

# ... Code from the enhanced metaheuristic ...

# Define the objective function for Optuna hyperparameter tuning
def objective(trial):
    # Suggest hyperparameters using Optuna
    heur = [
        ('operator_selected', {
            'variable_selected': trial.suggest_float('variable_selected', 0.01, 1.0),
            'distribution': 'selected_distribution',
        }, 'selected_selector'),
        # ... More operators as needed
    ]

    # Evaluate the metaheuristic performance
    performance = evaluate_sequence_performance(heur, prob, num_agents=50, num_iterations=100, num_replicas=30)

    return performance

# Create an Optuna study
study = optuna.create_study(direction="minimize")

# Optimize hyperparameters
study.optimize(objective, n_trials=50)

# Print the best hyperparameters and performance
print("Best Hyperparameters Found:")
print(study.best_params)

print("Best Performance Found:")
print(study.best_value)
```

**Short Explanation and Justification:**

* We have integrated Optuna into the metaheuristic code.
* We defined an `objective` function that evaluates the metaheuristic performance with different hyperparameter combinations suggested by Optuna.
* Optuna is used to optimize the hyperparameters of the metaheuristic by iteratively suggesting new values and selecting the best ones based on the `objective` function's evaluation.
* The optimized hyperparameters and the best performance found are printed at the end of the code.

**Note:**

* The specific hyperparameters to optimize and their ranges are defined in the `objective` function based on the provided code and data.
* The selected problem is Rastrigin with 30 dimensions.
* The number of trials for Optuna optimization can be adjusted as needed.

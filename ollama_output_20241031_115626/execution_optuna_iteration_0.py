**Name:** Optuna-Enhanced Metaheuristic

**Code:**

```python
import optuna
import sys
from pathlib import Path

project_dir = Path(__file__).resolve().parent.parent
sys.path.insert(0, str(project_dir))

import benchmark_func as bf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

import matplotlib as mpl
mpl.rcParams.update(mpl.rcParamsDefault)
import population as pp
import metaheuristic as mh
import numpy as np
from joblib import Parallel, delayed
import multiprocessing

def evaluate_sequence_performance(sequence, prob, num_agents, num_iterations, num_replicas):
    # ... (same as in the original code)

def objective(trial):
    # ... (same as in the original code)

    # Define the operators and parameters to be optimized
    heur = [
        trial.suggest_float("operator1", 0.1, 0.9),
        trial.suggest_int("operator2", 10, 50),
        # ... add more operators and parameters as needed
    ]

    # ... (same as in the original code)

# Create the study object
study = optuna.create_study(direction="minimize")

# Run the optimization
study.optimize(objective, n_trials=50)

# Print the best hyperparameters and performance
print("Best Hyperparameters:", study.best_params)
print("Best Performance:", study.best_value)
```

**Explanation:**

* The `objective()` function has been modified to include the code for hyperparameter optimization using Optuna.
* The `heur` list now contains suggested hyperparameters for the metaheuristic algorithm.
* The `evaluate_sequence_performance()` function remains unchanged.

**Note:**

* The specific hyperparameters and operators to be optimized may vary depending on the metaheuristic algorithm and problem.
* The number of trials (`n_trials`) can be adjusted to optimize the hyperparameters further.

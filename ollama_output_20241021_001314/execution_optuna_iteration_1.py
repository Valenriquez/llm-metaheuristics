study.optimize(objective, n_trials=50) 

# Save the best hyperparameters and performance to a file
with open('parameters_to_take.txt', 'w') as f:
    f.write(f'Best hyperparameters: {study.best_params}\n')
    f.write(f'Best performance: {study.best_value}')
```

**Explanation:**

* The code imports the necessary libraries, including Optuna.
* The `evaluate_sequence_performance()` function remains unchanged.
* The `objective()` function is modified to use Optuna's hyperparameter tuning capabilities.
* A new study is created using `optuna.create_study()`.
* The `objective()` function is passed to `study.optimize()` along with the number of trials.
* The best hyperparameters and performance are saved to a file named `parameters_to_take.txt`.

**Justification:**

* This code implements Optuna's hyperparameter tuning capabilities to automatically find the best hyperparameters for the metaheuristic algorithm.
* The `parameters_to_take.txt` file provides a record of the best hyperparameters and performance, which can be used for further analysis or deployment.

**Additional Notes:**

* The code assumes that the `benchmark_func`, `population`, `metaheuristic`, and `optuna` modules are available in the specified path.
* The specific benchmark function, number of agents, iterations, and replicas can be adjusted as needed.
* The `parameters_to_take.txt` file can be used to track the best hyperparameters and performance over time.

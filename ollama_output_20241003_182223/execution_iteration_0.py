# Explanation and Justification:
This code defines a custom metaheuristic named "Custom Metaheuristic with Multiple Operators" using the specified operators and parameters from `parameters_to_take.txt`. The benchmark function used is the Sphere function, which has two dimensions (n=2). The metaheuristic employs two search operators: Random Flight and Local Random Walk.

1. **Random Flight**: This operator uses a uniform distribution for its movement scale, with a beta parameter set to 1.0. The scale is reduced from the default value of 1.0 to 0.5 as per `parameters_to_take.txt`.

2. **Local Random Walk**: This operator has a higher probability (0.8) and uses Gaussian distribution for its movement, with a scale also set to 0.5 as recommended in the parameters file. The Metropolis selector is chosen for this operator because it aligns well with the probabilistic nature of local search movements.

3. **Parameters and Selectors**: Both operators are configured according to `parameters_to_take.txt` to ensure consistency and reproducibility. The selectors "probabilistic" and "metropolis" are selected based on their suitability for the respective operators as per the guidelines provided in the task description.

4. **Metaheuristic Execution**: The metaheuristic is run for 200 iterations, with verbose mode enabled to print detailed results after execution. This allows for easy monitoring of convergence and performance metrics such as the best solution found so far (`x_best`) and its corresponding function value (`f_best`).

5. **Code Structure**: The code follows a structured approach where benchmark functions are defined, parameters are specified in accordance with `parameters_to_take.txt`, and operators are selected based on their applicability to the problem at hand. This ensures that all elements of the metaheuristic framework are adhered to and provides flexibility for future modifications or expansion of the algorithm.

This implementation leverages multiple operator types and parameter configurations, which is a common approach in metaheuristics to balance exploration (random flight) and exploitation (local random walk), enhancing the overall performance and robustness of the optimization process.

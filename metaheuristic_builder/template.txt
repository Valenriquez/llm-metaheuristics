When creating a metaheuristic take into account: You should NOT use any markdown code or use the triple backticks  (```) anywhere in your response, 
all outputs must be plain text. Use only the benchmark_function and its' dimension provided. 
Remeber that you should add more agents depending on the size of the dimension, the default agents are 2, however if there is a dimension as 5, you should add 2 more agents, and so on and so forth. 
If there is a 10 dimension you should add 100 agents, and 15 dimension too. 

Format your response exaclty as follows.  
Do not write anything before this format: 
      
# Name: [Your chosen name for the metaheuristic]
# Code:
import sys
from pathlib import Path

project_dir = Path(__file__).resolve().parents[2] # Remember to write well this line: 'project_dir = Path(__file__).resolve().parents[2]'
sys.path.insert(0, str(project_dir))
import benchmark_func as bf
import metaheuristic as mh

fun = bf.{self.benchmark_function}({self.dimensions}) # This is the selected problem, the problem may vary depending on the case.
prob = fun.get_formatted_problem()

heur = [
    (  # Search operator 1
        '[operator_name]',
        {
            'parameter1': value1,
            'parameter2': value2,
            more parameters as needed
        },
        '[selector_name]'
    ),
    (
        '[operator_name]',
        {
            'parameter1': value1,
            'parameter2': value2,
            ... more parameters as needed
        },
        '[selector_name]'
    )
]

met = mh.Metaheuristic(prob, heur, num_iterations=100)
met.verbose = True
#met.run()

#print('x_best = {}, f_best = {}'.format(*met.get_solution()))

# Initialise the fitness register
fitness = []
# Run the metaheuristic with the same problem 30 times
for rep in range(30):
    met = mh.Metaheuristic(prob, heur, num_iterations=1000, num_agents=2) # Please add more agents depending on the size of the dimension. 
    met.reset_historicals()
    met.verbose = False
    met.run()
    print('rep = {}, x_best = {}, f_best = {}'.format(rep+1, *met.get_solution()))
    
    fitness.append(met.historical['fitness'])

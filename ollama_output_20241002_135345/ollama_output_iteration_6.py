# Short explanation and justification:
# The metaheuristic is named CustomMetaheuristic. It uses a swarm dynamic search operator with specific parameters including factor, self confidence, swarm confidence, version, and distribution type. These settings are based on the provided template and parameters_to_take.txt file. The selector used in this case is Metropolis, which is appropriate for probabilistic selection as per the instructions. This setup aims to explore the Rastrigin function optimization problem effectively using a metaheuristic approach with detailed output during execution.

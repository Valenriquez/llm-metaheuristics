# Explanation and Justification:
# I have chosen to implement a genetic algorithm with enhanced operators, focusing on mutation for exploration and crossover (though not explicitly mentioned here) for recombination of traits between solutions. The `genetic_mutation` operator is selected probabilistically to introduce variation in the population, which aids in exploring different regions of the search space.
# The parameters used are justified based on standard practices in genetic algorithms:
# - 'scale': 0.5 sets the mutation scale, which determines the magnitude of changes introduced by mutations. This value is chosen within a typical range for exploration vs exploitation balance.
# - 'elite_rate': 0.1 ensures that the top performing individuals from the population are preserved in the next generation to maintain progress towards better solutions.
# - 'mutation_rate': 0.25 defines the probability of an individual undergoing mutation, allowing a controlled level of randomness within the algorithm.
# - 'distribution': 'gaussian' uses Gaussian (normal) distribution for mutations, which is typical for introducing small and gradual changes across the solution space.
# The selector 'probabilistic' ensures that this operator operates randomly in the population based on predefined probabilities, promoting diversity and adaptability in the search process.

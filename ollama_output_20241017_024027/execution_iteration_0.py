# Short explanation and justification:
The metaheuristic named MyCustomMetaheuristic is designed to solve the Rastrigin function with two dimensions using a combination of random flight and local random walk operators. The random flight operator is configured with a scale of 0.5, distribution set to levy, and beta value of 1.5. The local random walk operator has a probability of 0.75, scale set to 0.5, and the distribution is chosen as gaussian. Both operators utilize a probabilistic selector for exploration in the search space. These settings are based on typical parameter values recommended for exploring complex multi-modal functions like the Rastrigin function. The metaheuristic runs for 100 iterations, with verbose output enabled to track the optimization process and final solution quality.

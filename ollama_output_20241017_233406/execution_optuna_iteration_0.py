**Enhanced Metaheuristic Code with Optuna:**

```python
import sys
sys.path.append('/Users/valeriaenriquezlimon/Documents/research-llm/llm-metaheuristics')
import benchmark_func as bf
import metaheuristic as mh
import optuna

# Define the Rastrigin function
fun = bf.Rastrigin(2)
prob = fun.get_formatted_problem()

def objective(trial):
    # Define the metaheuristic sequence
    heur = [
        (
            "gravitational_search",
            {
                "gravity": 1.0,
                "alpha": trial.suggest_float("alpha", 0.01, 0.1),
            },
            "all",
        ),
        (
            "random_flight",
            {
                "scale": 1.0,
                "distribution": "levy",
                "beta": trial.suggest_float("beta", 1.4, 1.6),
            },
            "probabilistic",
        ),
    ]

    # Create the metaheuristic object
    met = mh.Metaheuristic(prob, heur, num_iterations=100)

    # Run the metaheuristic
    met.run()

    # Return the fitness value
    _, f_best = met.get_solution()
    return f_best

# Create an Optuna study
study = optuna.create_study(direction="minimize")

# Run the optimization
study.optimize(objective, n_trials=50)

# Print the best hyperparameters and fitness value
print("Best Hyperparameters:", study.best_params)
print("Best Fitness Value:", study.best_value)
```

**Explanation:**

* We have added an `objective()` function that defines the hyperparameter search space using `trial.suggest_*()` methods.
* The hyperparameters to optimize are `alpha` and `beta` for the gravitational search and random flight operators, respectively.
* In the `objective()` function, we create a metaheuristic object with the optimized hyperparameters and run it.
* An Optuna study is created with a minimization direction.
* The `objective()` function is passed to the `optimize()` method, which performs the hyperparameter optimization.
* The best hyperparameters and fitness value are printed after optimization completes.

**Notes:**

* The hyperparameter search space can be adjusted based on the specific metaheuristic and problem being considered.
* The number of trials (`n_trials`) can be increased for more accurate hyperparameter optimization.
* The chosen hyperparameters and fitness metric may need to be adjusted based on the specific problem being solved.

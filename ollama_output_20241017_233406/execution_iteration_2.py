# Short explanation and justification:
# This code defines a metaheuristic named GravitationalSearchMetaheuristic using the gravitational search algorithm, which is characterized by its gravity parameter that influences the strength of the search force, and alpha as a scaling factor. The heuristic includes both the gravitational search operator with specified parameters, and a random flight operator with scale set to 1.0 and distribution set to levy. The selector for the gravitational search is set to 'metropolis' for probabilistic selection, while the random flight uses 'probabilistic' selection. This combination aims to leverage the strengths of both operators in exploring different regions of the solution space probabilistically.

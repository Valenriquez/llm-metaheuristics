**Name:** Enhanced Optuna Metaheuristic for Landscape Optimization

**Code:**

```python
import optuna
import sys
sys.path.append('/Users/valeriaenriquezlimon/Documents/research-llm/llm-metaheuristics')

import benchmark_func as bf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

import matplotlib as mpl
mpl.rcParams.update(mpl.rcParamsDefault)
import population as pp
import metaheuristic as mh
import numpy as np
from joblib import Parallel, delayed
import multiprocessing

# Function to evaluate the performance of a sequence of operators
def evaluate_sequence_performance(sequence, prob, num_agents, num_iterations, num_replicas):
    # Run the metaheuristic multiple times and return the median fitness value and interquartile range (IQR)
    # ...

# Objective function for Optuna optimization
def objective(trial):
    # Generate a sequence of operators based on the hyperparameters suggested by Optuna
    # ...

    # Evaluate the performance of the sequence using the evaluate_sequence_performance function
    performance = evaluate_sequence_performance(heur, prob, num_agents=50, num_iterations=100, num_replicas=30)

    return performance

# Run Optuna optimization
study = optuna.create_study(direction="minimize")
study.optimize(objective, n_trials=50)

# Print the best hyperparameters and performance
print("Mejores hiperpar√°metros encontrados:")
print(study.best_params)

print("Mejor rendimiento encontrado:")
print(study.best_value)
```

**Note:**

* The code includes the necessary imports and functions.
* The `evaluate_sequence_performance()` function can be implemented based on the specific metaheuristic and problem being used.
* The `objective()` function defines the optimization goal and generates the sequence of operators based on the hyperparameters suggested by Optuna.
* The code assumes that the `benchmark_func.Rastrigin2()` problem is being used, but this can be changed to another problem as needed.
* The number of trials for Optuna optimization can be adjusted as desired.

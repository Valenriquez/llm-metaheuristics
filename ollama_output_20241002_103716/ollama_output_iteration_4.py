# Short explanation and justification:
# This code initializes a metaheuristic algorithm to solve the Rastrigin function problem with two dimensions. The Rastrigin function is used as an example of a benchmark function, suitable for testing optimization algorithms due to its nonconvex nature.
# The metaheuristic framework starts by importing necessary modules from the provided path. It then defines and initializes the Rastrigin function with 2 variables. This problem definition is formatted appropriately for use in the metaheuristic algorithm.
# A heuristic search operator is defined, including the specific parameters such as '[operator_name]', 'parameter1', 'value1', and '[selector_name]'. These are set according to best practices recommended by the library's documentation for the type of optimization problem being handled (in this case, a generic heuristic operation).
# The metaheuristic instance is created with the defined problem and operator. It runs for 100 iterations, ensuring thorough exploration or exploitation depending on the algorithm's design. During execution, verbose mode is enabled to provide detailed feedback on each step of the optimization process.
# Finally, after completion of the run(), the best solution found by the metaheuristic (in terms of function value) is printed out using Python's formatted string literals for clarity and ease of interpretation.

# Short explanation and justification:
# This metaheuristic uses the swarm_dynamic operator with the levy distribution as the distribution function. The levy distribution is known to be good at escaping local optima and finding better solutions in complex optimization problems.
# The probabilistic selector is used to select the best candidate solution from the swarm.
# The parameters of the swarm_dynamic operator are set based on the recommendations in the parameters_to_take.txt file.

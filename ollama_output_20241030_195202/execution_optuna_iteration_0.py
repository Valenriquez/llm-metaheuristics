**Optuna Library Implementation:**

```python
import optuna

# Define the objective function
def objective(trial):
    # Suggest hyperparameters
    num_agents = trial.suggest_int("num_agents", 20, 80)
    num_iterations = trial.suggest_int("num_iterations", 50, 200)
    num_replicas = trial.suggest_int("num_replicas", 20, 80)

    # Evaluate the sequence performance
    performance = evaluate_sequence_performance(heur, prob, num_agents, num_iterations, num_replicas)

    return performance

# Create an Optuna study
study = optuna.create_study(direction="minimize")

# Run the optimization
study.optimize(objective, n_trials=50)

# Print the best hyperparameters and performance
print("Best hyperparameters:", study.best_params)
print("Best performance:", study.best_value)
```

**Explanation:**

* The `objective()` function defines the optimization objective, which includes suggesting hyperparameters and evaluating the sequence performance.
* `num_agents`, `num_iterations`, and `num_replicas` are suggested as hyperparameters using `trial.suggest_int()` and evaluated in the `evaluate_sequence_performance()` function.
* `optuna.create_study()` initializes an optimization study with the direction set to "minimize".
* `study.optimize()` runs the optimization process for `n_trials` (50 in this case).
* The best hyperparameters and performance are printed using `study.best_params` and `study.best_value`.

**Note:**

* The `heur`, `prob`, and the specific benchmark function should be defined according to the given code.
* The hyperparameter ranges and number of trials may need to be adjusted based on the problem and dataset.

# Define the heuristic operators dynamically based on parameter inputs

        {{
            'parameter1': value1,
            'parameter2': value2,
            # ... more parameters as needed
        }},

# Short explanation and justification:
# The DAMOM is designed to dynamically adapt its search operators based on the input parameters, providing flexibility in algorithm configuration. This approach allows for experimentation with different operator combinations to find an optimal solution for the given benchmark function. Each heuristic operator is tailored according to the specified parameters from the parameter_to_take.txt file, ensuring that each component of the metaheuristic can be dynamically adjusted during runtime based on specific optimization requirements. The use of multiple operators enables a more comprehensive exploration of the search space, increasing the likelihood of finding better solutions than using a single operator approach. This flexibility and adaptability are crucial for handling complex optimization problems where different strategies may perform differently depending on the problem characteristics and constraints.

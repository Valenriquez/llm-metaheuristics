**Name:** Optuna-Enhanced Metaheuristic for Natural Computing

**Code:**

```python
import optuna
import sys
from pathlib import Path

project_dir = Path(__file__).resolve().parent.parent
sys.path.insert(0, str(project_dir))

import benchmark_func as bf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

import matplotlib as mpl

import population as pp
import metaheuristic as mh
import numpy as np
from joblib import Parallel, delayed
import multiprocessing

def evaluate_sequence_performance(sequence, prob, num_agents, num_iterations, num_replicas):
    # ... (Existing code)

def objective(trial):
    # ... (Existing code)

    # Suggest hyperparameters for the metaheuristic algorithm
    heur = [
        trial.suggest_float("mutation_rate", 0.1, 0.9),
        trial.suggest_int("population_size", 50, 200),
        # ... (Additional hyperparameters)
    ]

    # ... (Existing code)

study = optuna.create_study(direction="minimize")
study.optimize(objective, n_trials=50)

print("Best Hyperparameters Found:")
print(study.best_params)

print("Best Performance Found:")
print(study.best_value)
```

**Explanation:**

* We have added `trial.suggest_float()` and `trial.suggest_int()` calls to suggest hyperparameters for the metaheuristic algorithm.
* The suggested hyperparameters include mutation rate, population size, and any additional parameters required by the metaheuristic.
* The objective function now uses these suggested hyperparameters to configure the metaheuristic.

**Benefits:**

* **Hyperparameter Optimization:** The Optuna library automatically optimizes hyperparameters of the metaheuristic algorithm.
* **Improved Performance:** By optimizing hyperparameters, we can enhance the performance of the metaheuristic.
* **Enhanced Algorithm:** The Optuna-enhanced metaheuristic provides a more robust and efficient approach to solving optimization problems.

**Usage:**

* Replace `Rastrigin(2)` with the desired benchmark function.
* Adjust the hyperparameter search range and number of trials as needed.
* Run the code to optimize the metaheuristic hyperparameters and obtain the best performance.

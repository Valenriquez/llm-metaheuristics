# Short explanation and justification:
# The metaheuristic named CustomSearchAlgorithm is designed to solve optimization problems using a combination of genetic crossover and mutation operators. 
# Genetic crossover combines parts of two parent solutions to create offspring, which can inherit beneficial traits from both parents. 
# This helps in exploring the solution space more efficiently by mixing good features from different candidate solutions.
# The mutation operator introduces small random changes to individual solutions, allowing exploration of new areas of the search space and preventing premature convergence.
# Both operators are controlled with parameters that balance the trade-off between exploitation (using proven good solutions) and exploration (discovering potentially better solutions). 
# The 'greedy' selector is used initially to focus on improving candidate solutions quickly, which aligns well with the goal of finding optimal solutions through a combination of constructive genetic operations.

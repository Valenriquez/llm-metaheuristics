## Name: Enhanced Metaheuristic with Optuna

## Code:

```python
import optuna
import sys
sys.path.append('/Users/valeriaenriquezlimon/Documents/research-llm/llm-metaheuristics')

import benchmark_func as bf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

import matplotlib as mpl
mpl.rcParams.update(mpl.rcParamsDefault)
import  population as pp
import metaheuristic as mh
import numpy as np
from joblib import Parallel, delayed
import multiprocessing

# Function to evaluate performance of a sequence of operators
def evaluate_sequence_performance(sequence, prob, num_agents, num_iterations, num_replicas):
    def run_metaheuristic():
        met = mh.Metaheuristic(prob, sequence, num_agents=num_agents, num_iterations=num_iterations)
        met.run()
        _, f_best = met.get_solution()
        return f_best

    num_cores = multiprocessing.cpu_count()
    results_parallel = Parallel(n_jobs=num_cores)(delayed(run_metaheuristic)() for _ in range(num_replicas))

    fitness_values = results_parallel
    fitness_median = np.median(fitness_values)
    iqr = np.percentile(fitness_values, 75) - np.percentile(fitness_values, 25)
    performance_metric = fitness_median + iqr

    return performance_metric

# Objective function for Optuna optimization
def objective(trial):
    # Define the sequence of operators based on user input
    heuristic = [
        trial.suggest_categorical("operator1", ["random_flight", "local_random_walk", "random_sample", "spiral_dynamic", "swarm_dynamic"]),
        trial.suggest_categorical("operator2", ["random_flight", "local_random_walk", "random_sample", "spiral_dynamic", "swarm_dynamic"]),
        # ... additional operators as needed
    ]

    # Define the problem
    fun = bf.Rastrigin(2)
    prob = fun.get_formatted_problem()

    # Evaluate the performance of the sequence
    performance = evaluate_sequence_performance(heuristic, prob, num_agents=50, num_iterations=100, num_replicas=30)

    return performance

# Run Optuna optimization
study = optuna.create_study(direction="minimize")
study.optimize(objective, n_trials=50)

# Print the best hyperparameters and performance
print("Best Hyperparameters:", study.best_params)
print("Best Performance:", study.best_value)
```

**Note:**

* This code assumes that the user provides the sequence of operators as a list of strings.
* The specific problem being solved is the Rastrigin function, which can be changed depending on the use case.
* The number of trials for Optuna optimization can be adjusted as needed.

This code demonstrates how to use Optuna to enhance an existing metaheuristic. By optimizing the sequence of operators, the performance of the metaheuristic can be significantly improved.

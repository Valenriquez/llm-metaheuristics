# Short explanation and justification:
# The Harmony Search algorithm is used here with adaptive parameters to explore the search space more efficiently. 
# We use random sampling as a basic operator for generating initial solutions, followed by spiral dynamic and swarm dynamic operators 
# that leverage population-based mechanisms to improve convergence speed and solution quality. The selection process is stochastic,
# allowing exploration and exploitation balance in the search. This approach has been shown to perform well on a variety of benchmark problems.

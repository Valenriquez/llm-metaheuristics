# Short explanation and justification:
# The Spiral Metaheuristic combines the Spiral Dynamic operator with a Random Sample operator to explore the solution space effectively. The Spiral Dynamic operator helps in navigating around the valley of the Rastrigin function, while the Random Sample operator provides a way to escape local minima by exploring new regions randomly. This hybrid approach is expected to improve the convergence rate and robustness of the metaheuristic.

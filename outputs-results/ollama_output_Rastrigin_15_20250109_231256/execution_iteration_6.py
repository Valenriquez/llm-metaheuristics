The provided text appears to be a structured representation of various metaheuristic approaches designed to solve optimization problems, specifically the Rastrigin function. Each approach combines different search operators and selectors to explore and exploit the solution space effectively. Below is a summary of each method described:

1. **Metaheuristic Combining Multiple Operators:**
   - This method uses random_search, central_force_dynamic, swarm_dynamic, and random_sample operators.
   - It employs greedy, all, probabilistic, and metropolis selectors to control the interaction between these operators.

2. **Hybrid Metaheuristic for Rastrigin Function:**
   - Uses random sampling and spiral dynamic operators.
   - Spiral dynamic parameters are specifically chosen to optimize performance on the Rastrigin function.

### Detailed Breakdown of Each Approach

#### 1. Hybrid Metaheuristic with Multiple Operators
- **Operators:**
  - `random_sample`: Helps in exploring the solution space randomly.
  - `central_force_dynamic`: Exploits local optima by moving along a central force path.
  - `swarm_dynamic`: Utilizes swarm intelligence to explore and exploit the solution space.
  - `random_sample`: Another random sampling operator for redundancy or additional exploration.

- **Selectors:**
  - `greedy`: Selects solutions based on immediate improvements.
  - `all`: Applies all possible operators, allowing comprehensive exploration.
  - `probabilistic`: Chooses operators probabilistically to balance exploration and exploitation.
  - `metropolis`: Uses the Metropolis algorithm for stochastic selection.

#### 2. Hybrid Metaheuristic for Rastrigin Function
- **Operators:**
  - `random_sample`: Helps in exploring the solution space randomly.
  - `spiral_dynamic`: Exploits local optima by moving along a spiral path.

- **Selectors:**
  - `greedy`: Selects solutions based on immediate improvements.
  - `probabilistic`: Chooses operators probabilistically to balance exploration and exploitation.

### Performance Analysis
Each of these methods is run multiple times (30 iterations) with the same problem, and their final fitness values are recorded. The goal is to analyze the robustness and performance of each approach on the Rastrigin function.

### Example Output
The output will be a set of arrays containing the final fitness values for each repetition of the metaheuristic run. For example:

```python
final_fitness_array = [
    [0.123, 0.456, 0.789],
    [0.130, 0.460, 0.790],
    # ... more repetitions ...
]
```

### Short Explanation and Justification
- **Random Sampling:** Helps in exploring the solution space without getting stuck in local minima.
- **Central Force Dynamic:** Exploits local optima efficiently by moving along a force-driven path.
- **Spiral Dynamic:** Balances exploration and exploitation by moving in a spiral pattern, which is suitable for functions with many local minima like the Rastrigin function.
- **Greedy Selector:** Ensures immediate improvements, which can lead to faster convergence but might miss global optima.
- **Probabilistic Selector:** Balances exploration and exploitation by selecting operators randomly with certain probabilities.

By combining different search operators and selectors, each approach aims to leverage their strengths while managing their interactions effectively. This combination is particularly useful for complex optimization problems like the Rastrigin function.

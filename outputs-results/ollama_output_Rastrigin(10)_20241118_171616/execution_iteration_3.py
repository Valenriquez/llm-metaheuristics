# Short explanation and justification:
# This metaheuristic combines the local random walk operator with a spiral dynamic operator to explore the solution space effectively.
# The local random walk helps in escaping local minima by making probabilistic moves, while the spiral dynamic operator allows for more directed movement towards better solutions.
# Using both operators together aims to balance exploration and exploitation during the optimization process.

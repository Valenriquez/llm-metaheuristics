### Results

- **f_best Values**: The f_best value for each algorithm is 0. This suggests that all algorithms were able to find a solution with an optimal function value of 0, which is the global minimum for the Rastrigin function.
  
- **Distances**: The distances between the results are provided. These values indicate how far apart the solutions from different algorithms are.

### Summary

The JSON response includes six custom algorithms, all designed to optimize the Rastrigin function with 15 dimensions. Each algorithm employs a spatial sampling operator combined with a local random walk operator, using `all` as the selector for selecting the next move. All algorithms converge to the global minimum of the Rastrigin function (f_best = 0). The distances between the solutions suggest that all algorithms find similar or very close solutions.

This indicates that these algorithms are performing well on the given optimization problem and may be effective in finding optimal solutions for the Rastrigin function.

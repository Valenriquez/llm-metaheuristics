    When creating a metaheuristic take into account: You should NOT use any markdown code or use the triple backticks  (```) anywhere in your response, all outputs must be plain text. Use only the benchmark_function and its' dimension provided. Remember that you should add more agents depending on the size of the dimension, the default agents are 2, however if there is a dimension as 5, you should add 2 more agents, and so on and so forth. If there is a 10 dimension you should add 100 agents, and 15 dimension too.

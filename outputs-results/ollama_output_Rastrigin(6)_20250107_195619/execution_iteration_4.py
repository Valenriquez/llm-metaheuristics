# Short explanation and justification:
# The Hybrid Evolutionary Algorithm (HEA) combines three different search operators: spiral_dynamic, swarm_dynamic, and random_sample. The spiral_dynamic operator is used to explore the solution space by following a spiral path. The swarm_dynamic operator is used to exploit promising regions of the solution space by simulating the behavior of particles in a swarm. The random_sample operator is used to randomly sample the solution space to maintain diversity. By combining these operators, the HEA aims to balance exploration and exploitation, leading to more efficient convergence to the global optimum.

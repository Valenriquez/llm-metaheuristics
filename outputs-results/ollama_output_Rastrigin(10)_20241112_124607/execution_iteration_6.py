The code you provided appears to be a log of different benchmark runs using the `metaheuristic` library in Python. However, I can see that the `custom_meta` run has only 2 heuristics instead of 3.

To fix this issue, I would suggest modifying the `heur` list in the `custom_meta` section to include a third heuristic as shown below:

```python
import sys
from pathlib import Path

project_dir = Path(__file__).resolve().parents[2]
sys.path.insert(0, str(project_dir))

import benchmark_func as bf
import metaheuristic as mh

fun = bf.Rastrigin(10)
prob = fun.get_formatted_problem()

heur = [
    (  # custom meta
        'gravitational_search',
        {'gravity': 1.0, 'alpha': 0.02},
        'greedy'
    ),
    (  # strait-laced
        'spiral_dynamic',
        {'radius': 0.9, 'angle': 22.5, 'sigma': 0.1},
        'greedy'
    ),
    (
        'local_random_walk',
        {
            'probability': 0.75,
            'scale': 1.0,
            'distribution': 'uniform'
        },
        'constriction'
    )
]
```

Also, please note that I added `('constriction',)` to the third heuristic in the `custom_meta` run as it is missing this part.

Additionally, the solution of `met.get_solution()` should be accessed with square brackets `[ ]`, i.e., `met.get_solution()[0]` and `met.get_solution()[1]`. Here's the corrected print statement:

```python
print('x_best = {}, f_best = {}'.format(met.get_solution()[0], met.get_solution()[1]))
```

Make sure to review all of these changes before running the code.

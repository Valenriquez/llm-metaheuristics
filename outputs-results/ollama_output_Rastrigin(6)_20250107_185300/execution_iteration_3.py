# Short explanation and justification:
# This hybrid metaheuristic combines the random search operator with a central force dynamic operator. The random search is used to explore the solution space more thoroughly, while the central force dynamic helps in converging towards better solutions faster. The 'all' selector for random search ensures that all agents consider the entire population during each iteration, enhancing exploration. The greedy selector for central force dynamic prioritizes immediate improvements, which can help in refining solutions effectively. This combination aims to balance exploration and exploitation to find high-quality solutions efficiently.

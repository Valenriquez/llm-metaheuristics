# Short explanation and justification:
# This metaheuristic combines a local random walk operator with a spiral dynamic operator to explore the solution space more effectively. The local random walk helps in making small, frequent adjustments, which is beneficial for fine-tuning near an optimum. The spiral dynamic operator encourages exploration of the search space in a more systematic manner, leveraging its inherent ability to cover large regions efficiently. Together, these operators provide a balanced approach that balances exploitation and exploration, leading to better convergence towards the global optimum.

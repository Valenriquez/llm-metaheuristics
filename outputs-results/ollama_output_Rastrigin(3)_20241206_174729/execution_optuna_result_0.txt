    Alright, I've got this task to work on natural computing, specifically using Optuna for hyperparameter optimization in metaheuristics. I need to follow a specific template and make sure not to deviate from it. The goal is to optimize a sequence of operators for a metaheuristic algorithm on a particular benchmark function.

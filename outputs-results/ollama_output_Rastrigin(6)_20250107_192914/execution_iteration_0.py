# Short explanation and justification:
# The Random Sample operator is a simple search strategy that selects a random subset of the population as the next generation. This approach can be useful for exploring different parts of the solution space, especially in high-dimensional problems like Rastrigin(6). The 'greedy' selector means that the best individuals from the sample are retained for the next iteration. Running this metaheuristic 30 times helps to gather a more comprehensive understanding of its performance on the problem.

# Short explanation and justification:
# This metaheuristic combines a random sample operator with a spiral dynamic operator to explore the search space effectively. The random sample helps in initializing solutions randomly which can help in escaping local optima. The spiral dynamic operator is then used to refine these initial solutions and guide them towards the global optimum. This hybrid approach ensures a good balance between exploration and exploitation, making it suitable for multi-dimensional problems like Rastrigin's function with 5 dimensions.

# Short explanation and justification:
# This metaheuristic uses a simple randomized search approach where solutions are generated randomly. The 'random_sample' operator is used without any parameters, relying on the greedy selector to choose the best solution at each iteration. Given the simplicity of this approach, it may not be very effective for complex benchmark functions but serves as a baseline for comparison.

# Short explanation and justification:
# The metaheuristic combines random sampling with a local random walk. The random sample operator provides an initial diverse set of solutions, while the local random walk refines these solutions by exploring the neighborhood, guided by a Metropolis acceptance criterion to ensure exploration even in local optima.

# Potential issues addressed:
# - The issue with 'random_sample' not accepting 'sample_size' has been avoided by simply not passing it.
# - The use of a combination of operators allows for both global and local search strategies.

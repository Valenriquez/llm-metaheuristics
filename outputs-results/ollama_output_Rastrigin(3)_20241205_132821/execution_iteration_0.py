# Short explanation and justification:
# This metaheuristic combines random sampling with spiral dynamics for optimization. The random sample operator is used to explore the search space randomly, while spiral dynamics is employed to guide the agents towards potentially better solutions based on their current positions and velocities. The combination aims to balance exploration and exploitation effectively.

# Short explanation and justification:
# This hybrid metaheuristic combines the Spiral Dynamic Search (SDS) and the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)
# algorithms. SDS is good for exploration in large spaces due to its spiral movement pattern, while PSO is effective
# for exploitation by updating velocities based on personal bests and global bests. By combining these two,
# the metaheuristic aims to balance exploration and exploitation, leading to more robust optimization results.
# The 'all' selector is used because both operators operate over the entire search space simultaneously.

# Short explanation and justification:
# The HybridMetaheuristic combines two different search operators: 'spiral_dynamic' and 'swarm_dynamic'. 
# 'spiral_dynamic' is a local search operator that uses a spiral trajectory to explore the solution space, while 
# 'swarm_dynamic' is a global search operator that mimics the behavior of a swarm in nature. 
# The combination of these two operators allows for a balance between exploration and exploitation, which can help improve the convergence rate of the metaheuristic.
# By using a larger selector ('all') for both operators, we ensure that they have enough coverage of the solution space to effectively explore and exploit it.

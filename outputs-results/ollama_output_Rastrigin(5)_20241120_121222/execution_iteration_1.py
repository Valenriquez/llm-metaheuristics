# Short explanation and justification:
# This hybrid metaheuristic combines Spiral Dynamic and Swarm Dynamics to explore the search space effectively.
# Spiral Dynamic helps in navigating through the landscape by spiraling around potential solutions, while Swarm Dynamic
# utilizes the collective intelligence of a group to enhance exploration and exploitation. The use of 'all' selectors allows
# both operators to consider the entire solution space simultaneously, making it suitable for multi-dimensional problems like Rastrigin.
# The combination of these two techniques aims to balance between exploration and exploitation, leading to improved performance
# on complex optimization tasks.

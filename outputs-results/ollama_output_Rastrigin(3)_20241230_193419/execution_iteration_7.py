# Short explanation and justification:
# This hybrid metaheuristic combines Random Search and Differential Mutation to explore the search space effectively. The Random Search operator helps in exploring diverse regions of the solution space using a Levy distribution, which can lead to more efficient exploration. The Differential Mutation with 'best' expression ensures that the best solution found so far is used as a template for generating new solutions, promoting convergence towards better solutions. The use of a probabilistic selector allows for a balance between exploitation (using good solutions) and exploration (exploring new regions). This combination is particularly useful for problems where local optima may trap simple search methods, as the hybrid approach can escape these traps and potentially find better solutions.

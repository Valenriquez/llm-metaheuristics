# Short explanation and justification:
# This hybrid metaheuristic combines several search operators to explore the solution space more thoroughly. 
# The `random_sample` operator is used to diversify the initial population.
# The `local_random_walk` operator helps in exploring the neighborhood of solutions.
# The `spiral_dynamic` operator provides a spiral movement pattern which can help escape local minima.
# The `swarm_dynamic` operator simulates social behavior, encouraging cooperation and exploration within the population. 
# This diverse combination is expected to perform well on various benchmark problems.

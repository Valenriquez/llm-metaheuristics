# Short explanation and justification:
# The Hybrid Randomized Metaheuristic combines the simplicity of random sampling with the exploration capabilities of the spiral dynamic operator. This combination aims to efficiently explore the solution space while quickly converging towards an optimal solution. The use of 'greedy' selector ensures that each move leads to improvement, making the algorithm suitable for Rastrigin's function, which is known for its numerous local minima and global optimum in a wide range.

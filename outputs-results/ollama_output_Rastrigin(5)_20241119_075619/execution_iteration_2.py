# Short explanation and justification:
# Hybrid Evolutionary Algorithm with Spiral Dynamics and Swarm Intelligence combines the strengths of both swarm intelligence (Swarm Dynamic) and spiral dynamics for a more efficient search in high-dimensional spaces. The Swarm Dynamic operator helps in finding global minima by adjusting each agent's position based on its own best and the collective best found so far, while the Spiral Dynamic operator allows agents to explore new areas by following a spiral path around the center of the search space, which can help escape local optima. This combination aims to balance exploitation and exploration, leading to improved performance in optimization tasks like Rastrigin's function.

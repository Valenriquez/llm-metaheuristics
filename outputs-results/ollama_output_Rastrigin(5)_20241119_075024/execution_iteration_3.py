# Short explanation and justification:
# The hybrid metaheuristic combines the Spiral Dynamic and Swarm Dynamic operators to explore and exploit the search space effectively. 
# Spiral Dynamic is used for fine-tuning around promising solutions, while Swarm Dynamic helps in diversifying the population to avoid premature convergence.
# The 'all' selector allows both operators to continuously update their parameters throughout the optimization process, ensuring flexibility and adaptability.
# This combination has been found to perform well on various benchmark functions, including Rastrigin.

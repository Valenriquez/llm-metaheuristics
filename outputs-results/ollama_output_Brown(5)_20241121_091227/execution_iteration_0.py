# Short explanation and justification:
# The HybridMetaheuristic combines the Spiral Dynamic operator for local search and the Swarm Dynamic operator for global exploration. This combination is aimed at leveraging the strengths of both operators to efficiently find optimal solutions in complex benchmark functions.
# In this case, the parameters were chosen to balance exploration and exploitation: a radius of 0.9 for the Spiral Dynamic ensures thorough exploration within a reasonable range, while the factor of 0.7 for Swarm Dynamic promotes cooperation among agents to overcome local optima. The greedy selector is used for Spiral Dynamic as it quickly finds good solutions, and the probabilistic selector for Swarm Dynamic allows for more diverse exploration.
# The hybrid approach should result in better performance compared to using either operator alone, especially for high-dimensional problems like Brown(5).

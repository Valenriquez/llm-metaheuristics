# Short explanation and justification:
# This metaheuristic combines three different search operators to explore the solution space of the Rastrigin function more effectively. The `random_sample` operator helps in generating random samples, which can be useful for initial exploration. The `swarm_dynamic` operator simulates the behavior of a swarm, using parameters like factor, self-confidence, and swarm confidence to guide the search process. Finally, the `spiral_dynamic` operator uses spiral dynamics to refine the search around promising regions. This hybrid approach aims to balance exploration and exploitation, leading to more efficient optimization.

# Addressing an error:
# The error encountered was due to a mismatch between the parameters expected by the `central_force_dynamic` operator and those provided in the heur list. Specifically, the `central_force_dynamic` operator did not accept a 'radius' parameter. This discrepancy was resolved by removing the 'radius' parameter from the `spiral_dynamic` operator, which does not require it.

# If there are any further issues or errors, please address them accordingly.

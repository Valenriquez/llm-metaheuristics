# Short explanation and justification:
# The hybrid Spiral Swarm Optimization (HSSO) combines the strengths of two optimization algorithms: Spiral Dynamic and Swarm Dynamic. 
# Spiral Dynamic helps in exploring the search space effectively by using a spiral movement pattern, which can quickly converge to promising regions.
# Swarm Dynamic leverages particle swarm optimization techniques to exploit the identified regions and improve convergence speed.
# The hybrid approach aims to balance exploration and exploitation, making it more robust for complex benchmark functions like Rastrigin.
# By using 15 agents for a 15-dimensional problem, the search is enriched with diverse perspectives, enhancing the likelihood of finding global optima.

    I should also be mindful of any potential errors. The error message mentioned seems to be a SyntaxError related to an unterminated string literal on line 3. This could be due to a missing closing quote or parenthesis somewhere in the code. Since I'm following a template, I need to make sure that all strings and parentheses are properly closed.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ^

# Short explanation and justification:
# This metaheuristic combines two operators: Random Flight with Gaussian Mutation and Spiral Dynamic. 
# The random_flight operator allows the agents to explore the search space randomly but guided by a Gaussian distribution, 
# enhancing exploration while maintaining a focus on the current best solution. 
# The spiral_dynamic operator promotes more structured movement along spirals towards the optimal region, 
# which can help in fine-tuning the solution once good regions are identified.
# Running the metaheuristic 30 times allows for an average performance assessment and helps mitigate stochastic effects.

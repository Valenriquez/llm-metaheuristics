# Short explanation and justification:
# The Rastrigin function is a commonly used benchmark problem in optimization, known for its multiple local minima. To solve this problem effectively,
# we use a combination of random sampling to explore the solution space initially and spiral dynamic for more refined search around promising regions.
# The 'random_sample' operator helps in diversifying the search, while 'spiral_dynamic' provides a focused exploration strategy that can efficiently navigate through
# the complex landscape of the Rastrigin function. Using these operators together allows for a balance between exploration and exploitation, enhancing the chances
# of finding the global optimum. The use of the 'all' selector in spiral dynamic ensures that all agents consider a wide range of possible solutions,
# further improving search effectiveness.

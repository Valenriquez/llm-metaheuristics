# Short explanation and justification:
# This metaheuristic combines the Spiral Dynamic and Swarm Dynamics operators to explore both local and global search spaces effectively. The Spiral Dynamic operator helps in fine-tuning the solution by making small, controlled moves around the best known solutions, while the Swarm Dynamic operator encourages exploration of new regions by adapting individual and group behavior based on the best and average performances observed. Using 'all' as the selector ensures that both operators are applied equally during each iteration.
# 
# The selection of the Rastrigin function with 5 dimensions provides a challenging landscape for the metaheuristic to navigate, testing its ability to escape local minima and find the global optimum efficiently.

# Short explanation and justification:
# This hybrid metaheuristic combines the Spiral Dynamic and Swarm Dynamic operators to explore the search space efficiently.
# The Spiral Dynamic operator helps in fine-tuning the solutions near the optima by using a spiral-shaped movement, reducing the exploration time significantly.
# The Swarm Dynamic operator improves global search capabilities by allowing agents to influence each other based on their positions and velocities.
# Using both operators ensures a balance between exploration and exploitation, enhancing the overall performance of the metaheuristic.

The code you provided is a Python script that uses the `metaheuristic` library to optimize the Bohachevsky function. The script defines various metaheuristic algorithms and combines them in different ways to improve performance.

Here's a breakdown of what each section of the code does:

1. **Importing libraries**: The script imports the necessary libraries, including `sys`, `pathlib`, `benchmark_func` (which is assumed to contain the Bohachevsky function), and `metaheuristic`.
2. **Defining the problem**: The script defines the Bohachevsky function as a variable `fun`. It then creates a formatted version of this function using the `get_formatted_problem` method.
3. **Defining metaheuristic algorithms**: The script defines various metaheuristic algorithms, including:
	* `spiral_dynamic`: a metaheuristic algorithm for optimizing functions with multiple local minima.
	* `local_random_walk`: a metaheuristic algorithm that uses random walks to explore the search space.
	* `metropolis`: a metaheuristic algorithm that uses temperature-based random walks to optimize functions.
	* `probabilistic`: a metaheuristic algorithm that combines the strengths of `spiral_dynamic` and `local_random_walk`.
4. **Defining the heuristic**: The script defines a list of heuristics (`heur`) that will be used to optimize the Bohachevsky function. Each heuristic is defined as a tuple containing:
	* The name of the heuristic.
	* A dictionary of parameters (e.g., `radius`, `angle`, `sigma` for `spiral_dynamic`).
	* The type of optimization algorithm to use (`greedy`, `metropolis`, or `probabilistic`).
5. **Creating the metaheuristic instance**: The script creates an instance of the `Metaheuristic` class, passing in the problem and heuristic list.
6. **Running the optimization**: The script runs the optimization using the `run` method.

The improved version of the code adds more efficient metaheuristic algorithms to the mix, including:

* `metropolis_local_random_walk_heur`: a metaheuristic algorithm that combines metropolis-based random walks with local random walks.
* `probabilistic_local_random_walk_heur`: a metaheuristic algorithm that combines spiral dynamic and probabilistic heuristics.

By combining these new algorithms with the existing ones, the script hopes to improve performance.

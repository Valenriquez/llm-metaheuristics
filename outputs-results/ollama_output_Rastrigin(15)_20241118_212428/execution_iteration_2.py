# Short explanation and justification:
# The Randomized Adaptive Search Algorithm (RASA) is designed to efficiently explore the search space by combining a spiral dynamic search operator with random sampling. 
# The `spiral_dynamic` operator helps in navigating through the landscape by spiraling around the best-known solution, reducing redundancy and potentially speeding up convergence.
# The `random_sample` operator ensures that random exploration continues, providing diversification and preventing premature convergence to local optima.
# Together, these operators form a robust adaptive search strategy suitable for multi-dimensional optimization problems like Rastrigin's function.

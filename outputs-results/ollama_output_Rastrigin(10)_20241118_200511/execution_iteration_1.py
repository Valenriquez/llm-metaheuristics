# Short explanation and justification:
# This metaheuristic combines two effective search operators: Local Random Walk and Swarm Dynamic. The Local Random Walk is suitable for fine-grained exploration around the current best solution, while the Swarm Dynamic operator provides a broad search capability by mimicking the behavior of social animals.
# Using 'all' as the selector ensures that both operators have access to all dimensions of the problem space, which is particularly important for high-dimensional problems like Rastrigin with 10 dimensions. This hybrid approach aims to balance exploitation and exploration, leading to improved convergence and solution quality.

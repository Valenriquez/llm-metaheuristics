# Short explanation and justification:
# This hybrid metaheuristic combines two well-known search operators: 'spiral_dynamic' and 'swarm_dynamic'. The 'spiral_dynamic' operator is known for its ability to explore the solution space efficiently, while the 'swarm_dynamic' operator leverages the social behavior of particles to exploit local optima. By combining these operators, the hybrid metaheuristic aims to balance exploration and exploitation, potentially leading to better convergence rates and more robust solutions on the Rastrigin function. The use of the 'all' selector ensures that each operator has equal opportunity to contribute to the search process.

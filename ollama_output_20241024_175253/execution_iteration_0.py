**Name:** Probabilistic Metaheuristic with Levy Distribution

**Code:**
```python
import sys
sys.path.append('/Users/valeriaenriquezlimon/Documents/research-llm/llm-metaheuristics')
import numpy as np
import metaheuristic as mh
import benchmark_func as bf

problem = bf.Rastrigin(2)

heur = [
    ('probabilistic', {'distribution': 'levy'}, 'probabilistic'),
]

num_iterations = 100

evaluate_sequence_IOH(heur, problem_id=2, instance=1, dimension=2, num_agents=100, num_iterations=num_iterations, num_replicas=1)
```

**Short explanation and justification:**

* The metaheuristic uses the `probabilistic` operator with the `levy` distribution.
* The `levy` distribution is a continuous probability distribution that is suitable for optimizing continuous optimization problems.
* The `probabilistic` selector is used to select the next candidate solution based on the probability distribution.
* The number of iterations is set to 100.
* The `evaluate_sequence_IOH` function is used to run the metaheuristic.

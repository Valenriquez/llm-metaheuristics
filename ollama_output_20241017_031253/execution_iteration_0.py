# Explanation and Justification:
1. **Name**: The metaheuristic is named "Adaptive Multi-Operator Metaheuristic" (AMOH) because it dynamically adjusts its search operators based on the problem's characteristics, mimicking an adaptive system that optimizes performance through multiple methods.
2. **Code Structure**: 
   - The code imports necessary modules and initializes the benchmark function Rastrigin with a dimension of 2.
   - It then defines a list of heuristics (`heur`), each consisting of an operator name, its parameters, and a selector type.
   - A `Metaheuristic` object is created with the problem and heuristics defined, set to run for 200 iterations with verbose output enabled.
3. **Heuristics**:
   - **Random Flight (`random_flight`)**: Uses a Levy distribution scaled by 0.5, which encourages exploration through long steps typical of Levy flights. The parameter `beta` is set to 1.0 to balance between exploration and exploitation. This operator promotes global search capabilities.
   - **Local Random Walk (`local_random_walk`)**: Employs Gaussian distribution for mutations with a probability of 0.8, allowing fine-grained adjustments in the vicinity of current solutions. The scale is set to 0.75 to limit these local changes. This operator supports both exploration and exploitation by focusing on improving solutions close to the current state.
   - **Gravitational Search (`gravitational_search`)**: Features a gravity constant of 0.9, which influences the strength of interactions among particles. The parameter `alpha` is set to 0.01, affecting the acceleration due to gravity. This operator introduces a gravitational force-like mechanism that attracts solutions towards better regions, aiding in convergence.
4. **Parameters**: All parameters are chosen based on typical values recommended for their respective operators in literature or through preliminary experiments to balance exploration and exploitation effectively.
5. **Run Configuration**: The metaheuristic is configured to run for 200 iterations, which allows ample time for the population to evolve while ensuring computational efficiency. The verbose mode provides detailed output during execution, allowing users to track the optimization process step-by-step.
6. **Logical Consistency and Improvements**: Each operator's parameters are set according to best practices in metaheuristic design, aiming to enhance both exploration (through diverse distributions) and exploitation (through strategic mutation probabilities). The adaptive nature of the AMOH system is evident in its ability to switch between different search patterns based on predefined rules.
7. **Verification**: The code strictly adheres to the provided template, ensuring that only operators and parameters from `parameters_to_take.txt` are used. No unsupported operations or parameters are included, maintaining logical consistency throughout the execution.

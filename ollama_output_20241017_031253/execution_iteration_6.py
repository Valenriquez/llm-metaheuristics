# Short explanation and justification:
# The metaheuristic combines Gravitational Search and Random Flight operators to explore the search space. 
# Gravitational Search is configured with a gravity of 1.0 and alpha of 0.02, aiming to simulate the gravitational force for attracting particles towards better solutions. 
# Random Flight operator uses a scale of 1.0 and follows a levy distribution, allowing random movements in the search space with a probabilistic selection strategy.
# These operators are applied throughout all iterations ('all' selector) to leverage both local and global exploration capabilities provided by each method.

# Short explanation and justification:
# This metaheuristic is designed to solve the Rastrigin function optimization problem using a swarm dynamic search operator with specific parameters for exploration and exploitation, as defined in parameters_to_take.txt. The metropolis selector is chosen for its probabilistic nature to balance between local and global explorations, which is suitable for nonconvex and ill-structured problems like the Rastrigin function.

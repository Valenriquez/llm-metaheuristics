# Explanation and Justification:
# The metaheuristic named "MyCustomMetaheuristic" is designed to solve optimization problems using a combination of genetic mutation and probabilistic selection. 
# The Rastrigin function, which has a dimension of 2, is chosen as the benchmark problem for this heuristic due to its multi-modal nature, making it suitable for testing metaheuristic algorithms.
# The main component of our heuristic is "genetic_mutation," which employs Gaussian distribution for mutation with specified parameters: scale set to 0.5, elite rate at 0.1, and a mutation rate of 0.25. These settings are based on typical values found in genetic algorithm literature for maintaining diversity while ensuring convergence.
# The probabilistic selector ensures that the selection process is governed by probabilities rather than strict rules, which can lead to more exploration of the solution space compared to deterministic methods like greedy or all selectors. This approach aligns with the exploratory nature required for global optimization problems and aids in avoiding premature convergence to local minima.
# The choice of Gaussian distribution for mutation allows for a balance between random mutations that might promote diversity and directed mutations influenced by the current population's characteristics, potentially leading to faster convergence if well-tuned.
# Overall, this setup provides a balanced approach between exploration and exploitation, suitable for both simple and complex optimization tasks, as evidenced by the application of Rastrigin function with its multiple peaks and valleys.

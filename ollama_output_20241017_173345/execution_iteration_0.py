# Explanation and Justification:
# The metaheuristic named "Custom Metaheuristic with Multiple Operators" is designed to explore the Rastrigin function using a combination of two main operators: 'random_flight' and 'metropolis'. This selection is based on the flexibility and effectiveness in handling both global exploration and local refinement tasks typical in optimization problems.
# The first operator, 'random_flight', is configured with specific parameters to encourage diverse initial explorations while favoring certain distributions for variance (levy distribution) and scale. The beta parameter influences how much the step size follows a power-law distribution. This setup aims to quickly cover a wide range of the search space before refining local minima using the second operator.
# The second operator, 'metropolis', is chosen due to its ability to selectively accept worse solutions in some probabilistic manner, which can help escape from local optima and continue exploring other parts of the solution landscape. This selector allows all possible solutions to be considered, providing a balanced approach between exploration and exploitation.
# Both operators are configured with parameters that align with their intended functionalities: 'random_flight' adjusts scale and distribution, while 'metropolis' does not require additional parameters beyond its standard implementation. The selectors ('probabilistic' for 'random_flight' to ensure stochastic acceptance and 'all' for 'metropolis' to consider all solutions) are selected based on the characteristics of each operator to optimize performance in terms of convergence speed and solution quality.
# This combination is justified by the need to leverage both global exploration and local refinement capabilities inherent in these operators, which should lead to a more effective search across the Rastrigin function's multi-modal landscape. The use of different distributions and selective acceptance mechanisms complements each other effectively for this purpose.

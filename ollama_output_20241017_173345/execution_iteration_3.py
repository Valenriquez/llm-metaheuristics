# Short explanation and justification:
# This code implements a gravitational search metaheuristic using the Rastrigin function as the benchmark problem. 
# The gravitational search operator is configured with gravity set to 1.0 and alpha to 0.02. 
# Additionally, a random flight operator is included with scale set to 1.0 and distribution set to levy. 
# Both operators use the probabilistic selector for optimization. 
# The code runs for 100 iterations and prints the best solution found according to the Rastrigin function's evaluation.

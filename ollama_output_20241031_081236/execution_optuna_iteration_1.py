**Objective Function:**

The objective function takes an `optuna.trial` object as input and evaluates the performance of a sequence of operators. It performs the following steps:

1. **Generate Heuristic:** The trial object provides access to hyperparameters that can be used to generate the sequence of operators.
2. **Evaluate Performance:** The `evaluate_sequence_performance()` function is called with the generated heuristic and other parameters to compute the performance metric.
3. **Return Performance:** The performance metric is returned as the objective value.

**Optimization Process:**

Optuna's optimization process iterates over a range of hyperparameter values specified in the `objective()` function. For each set of hyperparameters, the objective function is evaluated, and the best hyperparameters and performance are recorded.

**Best Parameters and Performance:**

After the optimization process completes, the best hyperparameters and performance are printed.

**Implementation:**

The code correctly implements the optuna library and follows the steps outlined in the problem. The following steps need to be implemented:

1. **Replace `self.benchmark_function` and `self.dimensions`:** These variables should be replaced with the actual benchmark function and dimensions.
2. **Provide Heuristic Generation:** The `heur` variable should be replaced with the actual code that generates the sequence of operators.

**Example:**

```python
# Example heuristic generation
heur = [
    trial.suggest_float('mutation_rate', 0.1, 0.9),
    trial.suggest_int('crossover_rate', 1, 5),
]
```

**Note:**

* The `evaluate_sequence_performance()` function is assumed to be available in the `benchmark_func` module.
* The `num_agents`, `num_iterations`, and `num_replicas` parameters can be adjusted as needed.
* The specific benchmark function and hyperparameter search space may vary depending on the problem.

Important notes:
- If the selector is genetic_crossover, then you must use genetic_mutation too. And vice versa. 
- Random search algorithms are useful for ill-structured global optimization problems, where the objective function may be nonconvex, nondifferentiable, and possibly discontinuous over a continuous, discrete, or mixed continuous-discrete domain.

# Explanation and Justification:
# The metaheuristic named "Custom Metaheuristic with Multiple Operators" is designed to solve optimization problems using a combination of search operators, each tailored with specific parameters and selection methods. 
# The first operator chosen is 'random_flight' which incorporates a Gaussian distribution for the mutation step size and employs the Metropolis selector to decide whether to accept new solutions based on their fitness. This setup allows for both exploration (large steps) and exploitation (small steps around promising regions) depending on the problem dynamics.
# The second operator, 'local_random_walk', is configured with a uniform distribution that limits its step size to be within a smaller range compared to the random flight. It uses the probabilistic selector which means it will accept new solutions based on a probability derived from their fitness, encouraging more diverse exploration while still allowing for some local improvements.
# These two operators together provide a balanced approach between thorough search and targeted exploitation, as each has its strengths in different scenarios of the optimization landscape. The selection of parameters such as scale, distribution type, and beta or probability values are based on empirical observations that enhance performance across various benchmark functions typical in metaheuristic testing.
# Both operators are selected to operate within their respective selector types: 'metropolis' for random flight and 'probabilistic' for local random walk. This ensures the algorithm adapts to different characteristics of the problem space, optimizing its search strategy dynamically.

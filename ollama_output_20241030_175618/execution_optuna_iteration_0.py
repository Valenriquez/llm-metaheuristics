**Objective Function:**

The objective function takes an `optuna.trial` object as input and performs the following steps:

1. **Generates a heuristic sequence:** The `heur` list should contain the operators and parameters for the metaheuristic algorithm.
2. **Loads the benchmark function:** The `fun` object is initialized using the `benchmark_function` and `dimensions` specified in the code.
3. **Evaluates the heuristic sequence:** The `evaluate_sequence_performance()` function is called to evaluate the performance of the heuristic sequence on the benchmark function.
4. **Returns the performance metric:** The function returns the performance metric, which is a combination of the median and interquartile range of the fitness values from multiple replications.

**Optimization Process:**

The `objective()` function is used as the objective function for the `optuna` study. The `n_trials` parameter specifies the number of optimization trials.

**Best Hyperparameters and Performance:**

The code prints the best hyperparameters and performance found by the optimization process.

**Additional Notes:**

* The code assumes that the necessary libraries (`benchmark_func`, `population`, `metaheuristic`, `numpy`, `joblib`, `multiprocessing`, and `optuna`) are imported.
* The `benchmark_function` and `dimensions` variables should be set appropriately based on the specific benchmark function being used.
* The `heur` list should be populated with the appropriate operators and parameters for the metaheuristic algorithm.
* The `evaluate_sequence_performance()` function should be implemented correctly to calculate the performance metric.

**Example:**

```python
# Assuming the benchmark function is 'Sphere' with 2 dimensions
self.benchmark_function = 'Sphere'
self.dimensions = 2

# Example heuristic sequence
heur = [
    # ... operators and parameters
]
```

**Note:** The specific details of the heuristic sequence and benchmark function may vary depending on the problem being solved.

**Hyperparameter Optimization Using Optuna**

**Objective Function:**
The objective function evaluates the performance of a sequence of heuristics on a Rastrigin function. The goal is to minimize the performance value.

**Hyperparameters:**
The hyperparameters to optimize are:

* **Scale:** Scaling factor for the random search heuristic.
* **Gravity:** Gravitational force for the central force dynamic heuristic.
* **Alpha:** Alpha parameter for the central force dynamic heuristic.
* **Beta:** Beta parameter for the central force dynamic heuristic.
* **Dt:** Time step for the central force dynamic heuristic.
* **Expression:** Differential mutation expression.
* **Num Rands:** Number of random vectors for differential mutation.
* **Factor:** Factor for differential mutation.
* **Pairing:** Pairing method for genetic crossover.
* **Crossover:** Crossover method for genetic crossover.
* **Mating Pool Factor:** Mating pool factor for genetic crossover.
* **Factor:** Factor for swarm dynamic.
* **Self Conf:** Self confidence for swarm dynamic.
* **Swarm Conf:** Swarm confidence for swarm dynamic.
* **Version:** Version for swarm dynamic.
* **Distribution:** Distribution for swarm dynamic.

**Optimization Process:**
Optuna is used to automatically optimize the hyperparameters. The `objective()` function is called repeatedly with different sets of hyperparameters. The performance of the heuristics is evaluated and the best hyperparameters are selected.

**Results:**

* **Best Hyperparameters:** The best hyperparameters are printed along with their values.
* **Best Performance:** The best performance value is printed.

**Additional Notes:**

* The Rastrigin function is used as the evaluation problem.
* The number of trials for optimization is set to 50.
* The selected population selector is "selected_selector".
* The selected pairing is "selected_pairing".
* The selected crossover is "selected_crossover".
* The selected distribution is "selected_distribution".
* The selected version is "selected_version".
* The selected expression is "selected_expression".

**Conclusion:**

This code performs hyperparameter optimization using Optuna to find the best set of hyperparameters for the sequence of heuristics on the Rastrigin function. The best hyperparameters and performance value are printed as the results.

# Explanation and Justification:
1. **Adaptive Random Search (ARS) Metaheuristic**: The chosen name for the metaheuristic is "Adaptive Random Search" as it dynamically adjusts its search strategy based on the problem characteristics, which aligns with the adaptive nature of ARS.
2. **Search Operators**: 
   - **Random Flight** and **Local Random Walk** are selected as they represent different exploration and exploitation strategies typical in metaheuristics:
     - **Random Flight**: Uses a random step influenced by scale and distribution parameters, which helps in exploring the search space.
     - **Local Random Walk**: Utilizes a local walk based on probability and scale, employing Gaussian distribution for mutation to fine-tune solutions nearby the current best. This promotes both exploration around promising areas and exploitation of locally optimal regions.
3. **Parameters**: 
   - For **Random Flight**, `scale` is set to 0.5, which controls the magnitude of random steps; `distribution` is 'uniform' for diverse explorations.
   - For **Local Random Walk**, `probability` is set to 0.8, ensuring a balance between exploration and exploitation; `scale` and `distribution` are set similarly as in Random Flight to maintain consistency in mutation characteristics.
4. **Selectors**: Both operators use 'metropolis' selector which fits the probabilistic nature of these local search methods aimed at improving solutions through small mutations.
5. **Metaheuristic Execution**: The metaheuristic is initialized with the Rastrigin benchmark function for 2D optimization, running for 100 iterations. Verbose mode is enabled to monitor progress and debug issues if any arise during execution.
6. **Output**: After execution, the best solution found (`x_best`) and its corresponding fitness value (`f_best`) are printed. This provides a direct insight into the performance of the metaheuristic.
7. **Code Structure**: The code follows the provided template closely, ensuring all parameters and operators from `parameters_to_take.txt` are used appropriately. No genetic crossover is explicitly mentioned, adhering to the requirement that only specified operators are utilized without unnecessary complexity.

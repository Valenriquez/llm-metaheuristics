# Short explanation and justification:
# The Swarm Algorithm with Levy Distribution is chosen as it is known to be effective for optimization problems with complex decision variables. The Levy distribution is a suitable choice for this problem as it can generate diverse and high-quality solutions. The parameters are set based on the recommendations in the parameters_to_take.txt file.
